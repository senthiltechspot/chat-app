# üé• WebRTC Video/Audio Calling Features

This chat application now includes comprehensive WebRTC functionality for group video and audio calls. Here's what's been implemented:

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Core Calling Features**
- **Group Video Calls**: Start video calls with multiple participants in any channel
- **Group Audio Calls**: Start audio-only calls for better performance
- **Screen Sharing**: Share your screen during calls
- **Mute/Unmute**: Toggle audio on/off during calls
- **Video On/Off**: Toggle video on/off during calls
- **Call Notifications**: Incoming call notifications with accept/decline options
- **Call Management**: Join, leave, and end calls with proper state management

### üì± **Responsive Design**
- **Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly call controls and responsive video grid
- **Desktop Enhanced**: Full-featured call interface with keyboard shortcuts
- **Adaptive Layout**: Video grid adjusts based on number of participants

### üîß **Technical Implementation**

#### **Frontend Components**
- `CallModal.tsx` - Main call interface with video grid and controls
- `CallButton.tsx` - Start video/audio call buttons
- `CallNotification.tsx` - Incoming call notifications
- `useWebRTC.ts` - WebRTC state management hook
- `useWebRTCManager.ts` - Advanced WebRTC peer connection management

#### **Backend (Convex)**
- `calls.ts` - Call state management (create, join, leave, end calls)
- `signaling.ts` - WebRTC signaling for peer connections
- Database schema for calls and participants

#### **Database Schema**
```typescript
calls: {
  channelId: Id<"channels">,
  createdBy: Id<"users">,
  callId: string,
  status: "active" | "ended" | "waiting",
  callType: "video" | "audio",
  startedAt: number,
  endedAt?: number
}

callParticipants: {
  callId: string,
  userId: Id<"users">,
  joinedAt: number,
  leftAt?: number,
  isMuted: boolean,
  isVideoOff: boolean
}
```

## üöÄ **How to Use**

### **Starting a Call**
1. Navigate to any channel
2. Click the "Video Call" or "Audio Call" button in the header
3. The call will be created and you'll be joined automatically
4. Other users in the channel will see an active call indicator

### **Joining a Call**
1. When there's an active call in a channel, you'll see a green indicator
2. Click "Join" to join the active call
3. Or click the call button to start a new call

### **During a Call**
- **Mute/Unmute**: Click the microphone button
- **Video On/Off**: Click the video camera button
- **Screen Share**: Click the screen share button
- **Leave Call**: Click the red phone button

### **Call Controls**
- **Mute Button**: Toggle your microphone on/off
- **Video Button**: Toggle your camera on/off
- **Screen Share Button**: Share your screen with participants
- **Leave Button**: End the call for yourself

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

### **WebRTC Implementation**
- Uses `RTCPeerConnection` for peer-to-peer connections
- STUN servers for NAT traversal
- ICE candidate exchange for connection establishment
- Media stream management for video/audio

### **Signaling**
- Convex mutations for signaling data exchange
- JSON serialization for offer/answer/ICE candidates
- Real-time updates through Convex subscriptions

### **State Management**
- Call state synchronized across all participants
- Participant status tracking (muted, video off, etc.)
- Call duration and metadata

## üîß **Configuration**

### **STUN Servers**
The app uses Google's public STUN servers:
```javascript
const ICE_SERVERS = [
  { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
  { urls: 'stun:stun1.l.google.com:19302' },
];
```

### **Media Constraints**
- Video: 640x480 resolution
- Audio: Standard microphone input
- Screen sharing: Full screen capture

## üì± **Mobile Features**

### **Responsive Call Interface**
- Touch-friendly call controls
- Optimized video grid layout
- Mobile-specific call notifications
- Swipe gestures for call management

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Adaptive bitrate for mobile networks
- Efficient video codec usage
- Battery optimization for long calls

## üîí **Security & Privacy**

### **Data Protection**
- No call recordings stored
- Peer-to-peer connections (no server relay)
- Encrypted media streams
- User consent for camera/microphone access

### **Permissions**
- Camera access for video calls
- Microphone access for audio
- Screen sharing permission

## üöß **Future Enhancements**

### **Planned Features**
- [ ] Call recording functionality
- [ ] Virtual backgrounds
- [ ] Chat during calls
- [ ] Call scheduling
- [ ] Breakout rooms
- [ ] Advanced screen sharing options
- [ ] Call quality indicators
- [ ] Push notifications for calls

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] TURN server for better connectivity
- [ ] Adaptive bitrate based on network conditions
- [ ] Noise cancellation
- [ ] Echo cancellation
- [ ] Bandwidth optimization

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Camera/Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions
2. **Can't join calls**: Ensure you're in the same channel
3. **Poor video quality**: Check your internet connection
4. **Audio issues**: Try muting/unmuting or refreshing

### **Browser Support**
- Chrome 80+
- Firefox 75+
- Safari 13+
- Edge 80+

## üìä **Performance Considerations**

### **Bandwidth Usage**
- Video calls: ~500KB/s - 2MB/s per participant
- Audio calls: ~50KB/s - 100KB/s per participant
- Screen sharing: ~1MB/s - 5MB/s

### **CPU Usage**
- Video encoding/decoding: Moderate to High
- Audio processing: Low
- Screen sharing: High

## üéâ **Getting Started**

The WebRTC features are now fully integrated into your chat application! Users can:

1. **Start calls** by clicking the call buttons in any channel
2. **Join active calls** when they see the green indicator
3. **Manage calls** with the intuitive control interface
4. **Share screens** for presentations and collaboration
5. **Use on mobile** with the responsive design

The implementation provides a solid foundation for real-time communication and can be extended with additional features as needed.
